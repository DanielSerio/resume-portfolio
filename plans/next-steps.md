## Next Steps

1. Set up `storybook` by creating stories in the `stories` folder, ignoring stories for ShadCN components and form components

## Q&A

1. For step 1 (Storybook): Do you want stories for any specific components, or should I focus on business logic components (excluding UI primitives and forms as mentioned)?

- Answer: Please focus on business logic components

2. For step 2 (Playwright): What are the most critical user flows you'd like tested first? (e.g., admin CRUD operations, main portfolio viewing, etc.)

- Please start simple with just admin CRUD operations
